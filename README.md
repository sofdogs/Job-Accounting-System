# Job Accounting System — Database Project

## 📚 Overview

This project demonstrates the design, implementation, and deployment of a full-scale **Job Accounting System** using modern database technologies. It walks through the entire database lifecycle — from conceptual design with ER diagrams to building a functioning web-based application using SQL, T-SQL, and Java.

The system is implemented and tested using **Azure SQL Database** and showcases both backend processing and frontend integration.
